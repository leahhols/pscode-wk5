// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Declare variables
a = 12
b = 10
sum = 22

Add the numbers
sum = a + b

Print the sum
print ("The sum is: " + result)


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Declare variable
number = 24

Check if the number is even
if number / 2
	print ("It's an even number)
else:
	print (It's an odd number)


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Declare variables
sum = 0
average = 0
smallest = 0
largest = 0

Read in five numbers
for n = 1 to 5:
	print ("Enter number " + n)
	number = readInput

Calculate the sum
sum = n(1) + n(2) + n(3) + n(4) + n(5)

Calculate the average
average = sum / # of variables (5)

Find the smallest and largest numbers
if n == 1:
	smallest = number
	largest = number
else:
	if number < smallest:
	 smallest = number
	if number > largest:
	largest = number

Write out the results
print ("The average of the numbers is " + average)
print ("The smallest number is " + smallest)
print (The largest number is " + largest)
